# SortingAlgorithmsTest
Application  to  benchmark  sorting  algorithms

This application include implementations of the five sorting algorithms, along with a main method which tests each of them. 
To benchmark the algorithms, was used arrays of randomly generated integers with ariety of different input sizes (100 - 10000). 
The running time (in milliseconds) for each algorithm measuring 10 times.
